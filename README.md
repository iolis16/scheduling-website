The client for this project is Vinaya Kulkarni, the founder of a math tutoring organization called Abacus West that teaches the abacus method to students. During a meeting with my client, we discussed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business. 
When it went online, the target audience became much larger as students all over the United States were able to attend online classes.
However, the shift from in-person to online services was difficult, and Abacus West is still looking for a system to effectively manage its students.  
Therefore, the product is being developed to assist in registering students and managing class information.

I proposed a web-based program for teachers in which they can register students and sort them into classes to Abacus West’s founder. 
The application is user-friendly, allowing teachers to enter student information into a form, and then sort them into classes with one click. 
The program also allows teachers to add additional classes as the organization grows over time.
